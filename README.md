# CS585-Project3
This project focused on the use of PySpark to solve various problems.  

The main focus of part 1 was to use Spark RDDs to generate queries for datasets containing the coordinates of healthy and infected people at a concert.  

For part 2, we had to utilize SparkSQL and MLlib to solve problems related to a customers and a purchases dataset.
